        Hear the term artificial intelligence (AI) and you might think of
        self-driving cars, robots, ChatGPT or other AI chatbots, and
        artificially created images. But it's also important to look behind the
        outputs of AI and understand how the technology works and its impacts
        for this and future generations.
      </p>

      <p class="done">
        AI is a concept that has been around, formally, since the 1950s, when it
        was defined as a machine's ability to perform a task that would've
        previously required human intelligence. This is quite a broad definition
        and one that has been modified over decades of research and
        technological advancements.

      <p>
        When you consider assigning intelligence to a machine, such as a
        computer, it makes sense to start by defining the term 'intelligence' --
        especially when you want to determine if an artificial system is truly
        deserving of it.

    <h1>How can I use AI?</h1>

    <p class="done">
      AI comes in different forms that have become widely available in everyday
      life. The smart speakers on your mantle with Alexa or Google voice
      assistant built-in are two great examples of AI. Other good examples are
      popular AI chatbots, such as ChatGPT, the new Bing Chat, and Google Bard.
    </p>

    <p class="style">
      When you ask ChatGPT for the capital of a country or you ask Alexa to give
      you an update on the weather, you'll get responses that are the result of
      machine-learning algorithms.
